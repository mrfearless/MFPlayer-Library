MFPlayer Library consists of functions that wrap the MFPlay COM implementation of the IMFPMediaPlayer and IMFPMediaItem objects. MFPlay is a Microsoft Media Foundation API for creating media playback applications. Thus the MFPlayer Library functions hide the complexities of interacting with the COM objects.

The MFPlayer library and source code are free to use for anyone, and anyone can contribute to the MFPlayer Library project.
